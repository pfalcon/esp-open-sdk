This directory contains simple examples/tests to use esp-open-sdk.
The directory would contain complete source for examples, but so far
examples with suitable OpenSource licensing were not found. So, this
directory contains just Makefiles for examples available elsewhere.

If you know about good examples to be included here with explicit
licensing terms (public domain is recommended, otherwise MIT/BSD is
OK), please let a maintainer know.

If you are able to compile an example and flash it successfully, 
but your esp enters a bootloop, you may need to flash
esp_init_data_default.bin and blank.bin to the correct addresses.
Both of these files and the corresponding addresses for various
flash sizes can be found in the sdk bin directory.
